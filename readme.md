# Some datapacks for Minecraft: Java Edition

...just crafting recipes, for now

* `copper_singlecut` [Crafting]
  > Allows you to craft single Copper Blocks into Cut Copper.  
  > Because the default recipe takes 4 and gives 4, this isn't much of a cheat.
* `craftable_saplings` [Crafting 3x3]
  > Craft Saplings by surrounding 1 Bone Meal with 8 Leaves.
* `craftable_sponges` [Crafting 3x3]
  > Craft sponges with Yellow Concrete Powder and Yellow Wool.  
  > From the top left of a 3x3 crafting grid, place Yellow Concrete Powder, then Yellow Wool, and repeat.
* `flex_dye`
  > Make Yellow Dye from Gold Nuggets, and turn Light Blue Dye into Blue Dye by combining it with Black Dye.
* `gravel_to_flint` [Furnace]
  > Smelt Gravel into Flint.
* `smeltable_copper` [Furnace]
  > Quickly oxidize Copper by using a Furnace.
