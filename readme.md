# Some datapacks for Minecraft: Java Edition

...just crafting recipes, for now

* `copper_singlecut` [Crafting]
    > Allows you to craft single Copper Blocks into Cut Copper.  
    > Because the default recipe takes 4 and gives 4, this isn't much of a cheat.
* `craftable_saplings` [Crafting 3x3]
    > Craft Saplings by surrounding 1 Bone Meal with 8 Leaves.
* `gravel_to_flint` [Furnace]
    > Smelt Gravel into Flint.
* `smeltable_copper` [Furnace]
    > Quickly oxidize Copper by using a Furnace.
